Vespertine
July 16th, 2007

pertine's cell phone cries out, howling away like a siren in the
dark, damp alleyway. The caller ID reads 'kaio999' and Ves answers
only to hear Kaio, all excited, "Wana kill something? It's an easy
kill." Interested, Vespers asks, "What'll I get?" Kaio replies,
"Amusement." Ves, "That doesn't pay the bills." Kaio, "By the way, if
you became a teacher, what would you want to teach?" Ves grins and
says, "Thievery."

After thinking a moment, Kaio responds, "Cool." Vesp continues with
the matter at hand, "I'm not going to hit until I get paid to do so...
You see, I'm still waiting for that coin from The Mafia." then,
realizing this is a laughing matter, Ves says, "I'm trying to make the
shit, not spend it." A seemingly carefree Kaio reassures him, "I'll
give you a couple K."

Standing up and stretching, Vespertine asks, "Who's the target?"
Kaio-"Elvenbane. She's down to 1-thirty-2." Ves-"Location?"
Kaio-"Nightingale and 52nd." Ves-"Where can I meet you for the coin?"
Kaio-"Tomarrow, since I'm limited for time. Just kill her. Tommarrow
I'll give it you." Then, Vesper asks lastly, "What clan's she in?"
Kaio assures him, "No clan." Ves responds, smiling, "Three K." and
hangs up the phone.

Urania was the closest station to him, and Euterpe was the closest
station to her. Getting to Urania was nice, lots of humans on the way.
Getting off at Euterpe was creepy. Ves could see the Graveyard across
the street. It was filled with really weird looking creatures, like
always. Getting to Elvenbane was no problem, as she was only 3 blocks
from the station. Arriving in her square, Ves noticed she had no shoes
on, just some ragged jeans and a messy tank top.

Two sprays of garlic and a few scrolls later, she was dead. Vespertine
stands over her for more than a few moments, taking in her eternal
beauty and her undying essence, something no Vampire can ever lose. He
thinks to himself, 'This is not death for her, eventhough she looks
it, feels it. Ves stands over her thinking about, not what she did to
get here but, where she'll go because of it. Eventhough she's dead,
every possibility lay before her.'

Then, it occurs to him that the end is not the end that people assume
it to be. It's not the closed door that everyone shuts on themselves.
The end is only another beginning. It is only then that Vespertine
kneels down and removes an old, black Kitsune mask from his bag and
gently places it onto Rena's face.

"Sonno con questa mascherina."
