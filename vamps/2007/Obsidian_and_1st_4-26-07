Vespertine
April 26th, 2007

After speaking with AllyAmour, it was clear her mystery had been
solved. She's just an ordinary, average, every-night Vampire. She was
still questing and told Ves that she wasn't really interested in
anything else. It all made sense and added up.

Vespertine wrote it off as 'nothing special' and went on scowering the
edge of the City for adventure. He noticed that there were really
weird Vampires hanging out on the edge. Almost like Sunset Boulevard.

It didn't take long to reach Obsidian and 1st. He'd been admiring the
castle's towers and spires from afar without realizing what they were.
Gothic architecture speaks volumes to a kid like Vespertine.

The moat of lava was a little intimidating, but then Ves remembered,
"You can die but you're never dead. Spiderweb." So, he says 'Fuck it',
downs a sprint potion and takes a huge leap of faith. The potion works
way better than it should have and he ends up right where he aimed, at
the top of that imposing front wall.

It's a really great view up there, ontop of that wall. You can see the
whole shire, the garden, down into the maze... As Vespertine turns
around to get a look at the city from this height, something catches
his eye. On the other side of the shire, there is a little cottage
like thing eminating all hues of light.

Focusing on it makes his curiosity burn as bright as the lights
flicker but the stench of sulfur permeates through the wonder and
warns of danger. Searching the sky for a dragon, Vespertine never
would have thought it was flying IN to the castle, from behind him. 

The winged reptilian's large wingspan creates such a force of wind as
it flies over it blows Ves off the wall and sends him sailing toward
the grounds of Warwick. After embedding the floor with his shape, Ves
lays there. Dead. Dreams start to take hold as the world fades away.
