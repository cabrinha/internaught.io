Vespertine
April 30th, 2007

Your body feels pretty heavy after getting up from a long drop,
Vespertine learned immeditealy after waking up in Obsidian's Castle
Shire with coins all over him. The only thing imbedded into Vesp's
frail memory was a big black dragon, bright lights, then like...
Flying? There was only little bit of the dream that wasn't completely
forgotten. An old man with a long white beard, gave him a message.

Tryss was the one that woke him up. He sits himself up in the feild,
thinking to himself, "What the hell was she doing throwing coins at a
vampire like that? Didn't I look like was sleeping?" Thinking on the
matter at hand for a good while, the lad comes to a good conclusion.
One of his sprint potions was missing! He remembered downing one a few
nights ago. "I knew those things were no good..." He tells himself.

Leaving Obsidian's Castle, the face of that... Alchemist flashes in
his mind. Disoriented from the past few nights, Vespertine decides he
must concentrate on his inner-Zen. He darts across the rest of the
grounds, all the way to the bank at Fear and 15th. Checking his
balance, there was only one thing on that vampire's mind. Theiving.
