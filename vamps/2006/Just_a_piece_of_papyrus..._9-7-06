Vespertine
September 7th, 2006

*Vespertine walks into the first floor of the building and heads
directly over to a wall behind the bar and pins up an old, crummy
scroll, which reads in black calligraphy*

'If you're interested in getting paid to steal from anyone or kill
anyone or deliver any various items while having loads of fun, track
down or contact that kid, Vespertine... His email adress is:
o0vespertine0o@...'

*He then adjusts his sunglasses further up onto his nose after getting
a good look around the place before proceeds out into the nite*
