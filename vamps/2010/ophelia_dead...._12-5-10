For those that don't already know some coward used the assassins to kill ophelia. We will be killing all cowards who use the assassins in the future, but right now at her funeral, there are nothing but the weakest of sentiments being tossed at her as if she would rather hear "rest well" than "we will destroy everyone because they touched you". Anyway, if you are interested in what I had to say on the matter feel free to check out the thread:

I have no idea what you just said. However we will do a lot of killing. Lot's of people need killed for many reasons.

And I'm sure many of us have itchy trigger fingers... A few too many of us have slept for far too long. I cannot imagine that ophelia is quite resting comfortably, though perhaps in her old age she has settled down. It plagues me to think of her as having softened in these dark times.

I have nothing against assassins, as I consider myself one in a way. But the Prince is right. 
If we're going to take the whole city by force, then the assassins are going to get in our way sooner or later. 
Besides, his response on the newspaper didn't exactly sound friendly towards this Ophelia person, when he 
told her to stay dead.

No, Cydonia. It was friendly. ophelia was once my grandsire, and she has always been known for her, well, chutzpah and ferocity. If she can find herself resting peacefully after this event, then she should let go of her legacy and resign herself to an eternal sleep.

I replied in full backing of your sentiments, old man. Killing the DA/splinters is just as relevant. Who's to say that the contractor is not in there? virgo_shelly was DA who tried to pay her own assassins for a hit. Regardless, taking a contract is a CHOICE, a voluntary decision to attack someone. In which case, they are just as guilty as the party who paid. KILL THEM ALL.

Then I misunderstood, and bow to the wisdom of our Leader, despite my opinion that a vampire as important as her, should also be bowing to him.

The mark will be the COWARDS of the city that need assassins to do their dirty work. I am sickened by the idea that they would even consider themselves vampires when they refuse to get any blood and dirt under their nails. Pathetic. The DA and Splinters are not our mark. Let some poltroon take a contract out on us, there will be no safe tucking away of any in our clan. We will fight. This city stinks too much of wanna be wahpires. Either be what you are or go visit the city of Twightlight.

Since I'm not a member of that board, and really don't want to be, could someone post what he said there? Thanks.

*hands Serena the obituary of a paper and it reads*

I hope you do not rest well. It sickens me to believe that anyone could rest well after being cowardly attacked in this fashion. It is insulting to believe that a vampire with your station and ability would not be tearing and twisting your very soul into ribbons.

Assassins/Mercenaries killed you. True they were paid, and those responsible deserve a fate worse than death for being such loathsome cowards that they didn't have the guts to at least attack with their hired help. However it does not excuse the fact that these vampires laid their hands on you and are allowed to walk away.

If after what has happened to you ophelia you can rest well. Then do yourself a favor and just rest forever. You are already dead inside.

*reads, nodding as she does* I agree, my lord. ophelia is a high ranking vampire, and we shouldn't let this go. I also agree with those who feel the assassins need to be removed from this city. Because of them, there is no longer any honor in being zeroed. Wars are no longer fought on a field of honor, but in a back street, with money being exchanged between cowards. *tosses the paper into the trash* I, for one, am ready to clean this city with the carcasses of said cowards.

ophelia is my grand-sire and I'd like to know who the contract was ordered by. If we could get some counter-intelligence on the matter, it'd be awesome. I'm down to kill assassins, too.
