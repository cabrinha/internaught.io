Message 1 of 8 , Jan 22, 2008

She was curled up in the corner of the booth Dil had found, her eyes
flicking quickly between the occupants of the hall and her note book.
The time frame for the experiment was drawing to a close and she
wanted to make sure she had everything down before it finished.
Underlining a specific passage and nodding in satisfaction, she tucked
the pencil in the loose bundle of hair at the back of her head and
slid out of the booth. One last thing left to do...

Picking up her half empty wine glass she took a sip before tapping her
ringed finger against the clear surface, hoping the sound would rise
above the noises in the hall and catch the attention of the pires
gathered within. A few heads turned her way, which was a good enough
sign for her to begin.

"I wanted to thank all of you for coming to RBC. I don't think any of
you will quite understand what it means to me that you have decided to
join here and help bring a little life back to the city halls. I'm
amazed that so many showed up, and it makes me hopeful for the future
of the city. No one here wants to see our home stagnate, and many of
you here now understand why I asked for us to gather here."

"Hopefully this has been the first of many gatherings. The idea
started out small, but I do think we can turn it into something
larger, something that will involve more and more pires as time goes
on, including the young ones." 

"I do wish to stress though that this could not have really happened
if you all hadn't been willing to come. Thank you to all the clans who
came, even if it was a single member. Thank you to the bloodlines who
attended and brought you childer and grandchilder. Thank you also to
the rouge pires and assorted..." Smiles at the Shambler. "Other beings
who came. I'd be very honored if I could call upon your support again
in the next attempt to revive the city center."

Raising her glass to the room, she made a small bow a took another sip
of wine. "So again, thank you all, and I do hope you had a good time.
Enjoy the rest of your evening."

Message 3 of 8 , Jan 23, 2008

Dilectus's attention turned away from much of the room over time, 
as he enjoyed sipping his drink and watching many of his clan mates 
enjoy themselves, despite having to pick a few pieces of pie from 
his hair. 
Two things caught the curious vampire's attention. First was Jean 
and Damari, appearing there had been some perhaps upheaval or issues 
in the past that lead to what appeared to be a new beginning, a 
continuation, or maybe it was nothing. Finishing his drink he nods, 
and whispers, "Not my business, but I wish them both well." 
The second thing that Dilectus was focused on was Mandolin, sitting 
there taking notes. He loved it, it reminded him of himself, back 
when he was human, traveling the countryside visiting those dark 
corners taking notes on a world he was now a part of. Could he love 
and appreciate her even more then he does now? Perhaps it was a bit 
symbolic the city finding a new life and Dilectus all the same time, 
with thanks to one wonderful pire. 
Dilectus was brought another drink just in time for Mandolin's 
toast. He was proud of her, and happily joined in the toast. AS 
she spoke, he knew he would be around the city for a while now, many 
of the task he had in the past have been settled, enemies defeated, 
but if trouble should rise again...he knew as he took a sip at the 
end of her toast, he had friends who loved him and he would never 
again fight alone.

Boomer leaned back and shook what she could of the lemon meringue pie 
out of her wavy locks. She grabbed her long hair into a ponytail and 
bounced it up and down to remove any stray pieces. The rest she'd 
have to wash out. She looked around and realized Sade had slipped 
away, perhaps to find a new victim.

She licked the rest of the sticky mixture of lemon meringue and 
cherry pie filling from her fingers as she listened to Mandolin's 
speech of gratitude. She clapped when it was done, because, well... 
one was supposed to clap at inspirational speeches. But inspired to 
stay she was not. A hot shower called to her as did cuddling in 
Torch's strong arms. It was time to get back to the Ivory Tower.

Using a chair for balance, Boomer righted herself yet again and 
looked out over the crowd. She knew many if not most of the vampires 
there, and was pleased to see their state of cleanliness was no 
better than her own. There was comfort in common chaos. She smiled to 
think of vampires and pies. How many of the kindred were old enough 
to know that early English pies were meat and bready concoctions 
known as 'coffyns' or that pies used to be made in long trough-like 
pans and that the pans were soon named coffins. Yes, vampires, pies 
and coffinsÂ… somehow it all fit together. Either that or she was 
still really stoned and over-thinking it all in one of those 
classic "everything is related" sort of ways. 

A few intact pies still remained on the pie cart. She eyed them all 
with malicious intent to extract her revenge on Sade. Then she 
realized she'd rather just take one home with her. Why waste a pie 
on someone already coated in crust when she and Torch could make each 
other "personal sweetie pies?" She was sure no one would say anything 
as she grabbed a cream pie and headed out the door of the hall. She 
giggled as she thought, "It's high time for pie time."

From a corner of the room, recently arrived but staying in the 
shadows, a lone vampire in a dark robe, wrapped in a travel cape, 
watched the gathering. Having arrived late to the meeting called by 
the beautiful vampiress he once was friends with, he didn't want to 
disturb but kept following with his coal eyes the events that 
developed during the late hours of the evening.

He felt he didn't have the right to join them, being absent for so 
long from these halls. Away? Yes, in a way. He was guilty of having 
abandoned many people, including his own, while he traveled abroad to 
discover more about himself, his own powers and his path upon the 
darkness. He did, indeed, but he couldn't say he was satisfied with 
the results. He had discovered he had lost most of his time trying to 
fill others' desires, others' dreams, and he had put his own aside. 
He didn't even recognize himself when he examined his latest deeds, 
but one... 

A image of a chess room filled his mind and the mage couldn't help 
but smiled, recalling a small silhouette dressed in green, a great 
frame for the indigo eyes looking at him, slowly swaying at the 
rhythm of the music. "Lilac", he thought, and his smile vanished. It 
was long ago since he last saw her and his heart jumped in... He 
didn't know how could he say it properly... it was more than 
longing... "Saudade", he muttered, recalling a word he learned while 
in Portugal. It was saudade, it was 'nostos', as a Greek could have 
said. It was feeling away while being there.

Looking back to the gathering, he heard the ending words of the 
hostess. It had been a great idea, he agreed. The hall was full, 
alive as it wasn't since the last great wars of ages gone. Louis 
smiled and, drawing a silver bottle filled with a hand-made 
concoction of vodka and blood, raised it in silence from his 
corner. "For you, Mandolin, and for all the friends and foes I have 
met on this city in all these years", he whispered to himself, and 
emptied the contents of the bottle.

Smiling again, the mage felt a missed warmth inside him. Yes, no 
matter as a shadow, it was good to be back in here.

Vespertine
January 25th, 2008
Knowing he was quite late, Vespertine went through extra lengths to
ensure a ridiculous entrance. Leaning his pink uni-cycle against a
streetlight, pie in each hand, full on clown suit, shoes and nose. The
shoes go without mentioning, as does the flower that squirts out blood.
A big red afro and badly drawn face paint help disguise the young
looking vampire so his appearance at the door is even all the more
surprising.

On his way in, he spots some vampires he hasn't seen for a long while.
So, instead of making a scene just yet, Ves decides to kick back at the
bar and get drunk, look around the room like a stupid human looking for
the wrong thing. 'I wonder if anyone is going to notice me...' he
thinks, draining a glass of alcohol and tapping the bartop for the next
one.

<After a few beats of the heart with both parties just staring at

"So Ronald, When will the Big Mac be on the Dollar Menu?"

Jocelyn sauntered about the halls, saying her goodbye's and avoiding the last few pie flingers. She was well and truly ready to return home to her husband, perhaps she would offer him some dessert. Unable to control herself she let out a delightful little laugh, smirking as she made her way towards the doors. Before she even reached them, they swung open, revealing an oddly familiar clown. The makeup rather messy, though the outfit had clearly had a lot of effort put into it, gave off the impression that this clown would be rather demented. "It can't be." She grumbled to herself, shaking her head at the thought. She would ask the young man later if he had happened to make an appearance, but for now, she wanted to just get home and certainly did not want to be noticed by the clown if it really was who she thought. Oh boy, she couldn't wait to tell Janus and see his face when she walked in covered in cream and pie filling. "Good night, Ravenblack City!" She called, waving once more to the room before slipping into the night, moving swiftly through the dark, empty streets.
